# Rules
Launch the bash script in order to create a folder with casual txt files and shell files
```
bash script_creator.sh

Then use the virtual env provided or your own Python distribution to launch the main.py file, this will analyse the files extension and catalogue them based on the first line.
## (Optional) Starting the venv
First activate the venv using:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```
Then launch the Python script
```bash
cd ex_1
python main.py
```
