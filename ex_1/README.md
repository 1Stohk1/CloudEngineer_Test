# Rules
Launch the bash script in order to create a folder with casual txt files and shell files
```bash
bash ex_1/script_creator.sh
```
Then use the virtual env provided or your own Python distribution to launch the main.py file, this will analyse the files extension and catalogue them based on the first line.
## (Optional) Starting the venv
First activate the venv using:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```
Then launch the Python script
```bash
python ex_1/main.py
```
